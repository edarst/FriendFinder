# FriendFinder

Determine who you align with by using FriendFinder, which matches user-input ratings on a series of questions.

## Functionality

A user takes a short survey to determine how strongly they feel on a range of topics, ranked from 1 to 5, with 5 being the strongest.

The app takes their responses and feeds them into the app to match them with famous footballers to see if they are a match for friends.

Finally, the user themselves are added to the array.

## Issues

On-click function is missing AJAX call to array. App can connect as local host but receive issues with Express when running. Must continue to fix core functionality with pushing new objects to the array and pulling them back.
